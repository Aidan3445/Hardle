# Hardle
Hardle brings the original Wordle back to its Mastermind roots.

The original version of Hardle was made in Java using a library from my CS Fundies 2 course at Northeastern University.

I recreated the game in the P5 Javascript editor.

There are several limitations with P5 that I would someday like work around but I'm very happy with the product. 

The game can be played at https://tinyurl.com/hardlegame 

Enjoy!
